What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system.

What is in this fork?
------
This is my personal fork of openpilot that includes modifications that I want and nothing else.  I drive a __2019 Rav4 Hybrid (TSS2)__ most of the modifications will only work on my vehicle type.

I am publishing this work to help others understand how openpilot works.  As such, __I am NOT providing support for installation or troubleshooting.__  If you are looking for a supported fork, I recommend [Shane's Stock Additions](https://github.com/sshane/openpilot) fork.

Currently this fork contains the following modifications:
* 3 Distance profiles that can be toggled using the distance follow button on the steering wheel.  
  * These profiles are a modified version of Shane's profiles.  See below.
  * There are no on screen messages regarding the distance profile selected, only the icons on the vehicle's HUD.
* Toggle disengage on gas from the settings->toggles screen
* Updates are permanently disabled and must be performed using `ssh` and `git`.

Will you add something?
---
You can certainly ask, but the criteria for adding it is:

* Is it something I would use
* Is it something I consider safe?  I am pretty cautious.
* Is it easy to maintain?  I don't want this to be a chore to maintain.

If the answer to any of those is __no__, then I probably won't add it. 

Distance Profiles
---
Shane's profiles were not quite to my liking.  First, I extrapolated out the speeds, so that the distance is set about every ~5mph.  This just makes it easier to edit.

* Stock - Unchanged, this uses the default settings in openpilot.
* Relaxed - I felt Shane's had barely any noticable difference over stock.  I modified mine to be a 1.5 second following distance across the entire range.  Below ~25 mph this about matches Shane's, above this speed it is a bit closer.  This largely falls halfway between stock and traffic.
* Traffic - At low speeds this feels about right.  But at high speeds, I did not like that it continued to decrease the following distance. Instead, after ~60mph the traffic profile becomes fixed to 1.2 seconds.
  * I particularly don't like the hump that occurs around 68mph - 78mph.  I think this could result non-ideal outcomes.

Distance Profile Cost Adjustments
---
As the following distance decreases I have decreased the `jerk` cost and increased the `danger` cost.  This is to be expected, as the follow distance decreases the allowable rate of change in deceleration has to increase, this will make the acceleration more jerky.  Below is an example of this, as you can see the relaxed and traffic profiles start off following the lead closer, and then when the lead starts to slow down, they increase their rate of deceleration much faster:

Development Process
---

The comma.ai repository is a [complicated beast](https://blog.comma.ai/a-2020-theme-externalization/).  The releases are are compiled stripped down repositories.  I prefer to base my daily driver fork `Rav4-TSS2` off of the `commaai/devel` branch.  However, this branch lacks the suite of automated tests.  So I create my development branches off of `commaai/master`.  I try to pick the commit that is closest to the release version and make a branch `master-x.xx` with x.xx being the release version number.

My branches that start with `feature_` contain additional features or tweaks that have not been upstreamed into `commaai/master`.  My branches that start with `upstream_` contain commits that have been developed by `commaai` but were not included in the last release and are likely to be included in the next release.

Once I am satisfied with a branch and it has passed the automated tests, or failed for understandable reasons, I cherry-pick the commits into `Rav4-TSS2`.  Sometimed I may create a `Rav4-TSS2-____` branch if I want to test changes in the vehicle before commiting them to my daily driver branch.

It is all a mess, and it would make working off of my branches difficult, but since this is primarily for personal use, it works for me.
